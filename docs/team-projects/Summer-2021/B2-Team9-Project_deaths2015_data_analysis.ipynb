A story can be told from a data set and this one provides interesting insights into the US population. Mortalities (deaths) can tell us so much about a population if there is proper recordings of the facts of both the people and the situations around their deaths. From this data many relationships between features are looked into to try and understand who is dying and what groups of people can be made.\n",

    "Through our analyses we investigated the relation between several demographic variables and mortality data in 2015.After initially observing a difference in death counts between males and females across age groups, we proceeded to analyze additional factors such as education level, manner of death, and place of injury. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although we observed that males have higher death counts, we see that males tend to have most deaths at younger ages than females do. When looking at deaths within each age group by day of the week, we saw that young adults tended to have a higher % of death on the weekends, while older age groups had more consistent % across the entire week. While analyzing death counts by manner of death, the data indicated that natural causes are the most common manner of death, whereas homicide was the least common manner of death. Lastly, the most common place of injury leading to death was at home for all age groups, and the least common place of injury was in a sports area.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our analyses we observed varying relationships between death counts and other variables in the dataset. While some of the conclusions were different by age group, such as day of the week, others showed more consistency across age groups, like place of injury. "
